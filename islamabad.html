    <a href="index.html"> Pakistan </a> </a> ,
    located in <a href="islamabad.html">islamabad</a> the capital of the country.
    It is the sixth-largest mosque in the world, the largest mosque outside the
    Middle East, and the largest within South Asia, located on the foothills of
    Margalla Hills. It is named after the late King Faisal of Saudi Arabia
    (r. 1964–75). Designed by Turkish architect Vedat Dalokay, the mosque features
    a contemporary design consisting of eight sides of concrete shell and is inspired
    by the design of a typical Bedouin tent.</p><br p> Construction of the mosque began in 1976 after a $28 million
    grant from Saudi King
    Faisal, whose name the mosque bears. The unconventional design by Turkish architect
    Vedat Dalokay was selected after an international competition. Without a typical dome,
    the mosque is shaped like a Bedouin tent, surrounded by four 90 metres (300 ft) tall
    minarets. The design features eight-sided shell shaped sloping roofs forming a triangular
    \worship hall which can hold 10,000 worshippers.
