    The city has been inhabited for around two millennia, although it rose to prominence in the late
10th century with the establishment of the Walled City, its fortified
interior. <b>Lahore</b> served as the capital of several empires during the 
mediaeval era, including the Hindu Shahis, Ghaznavid Empire and Delhi Sultanate.
It reached the height of its splendour under the Mughal Empire between 
the late 16th and early 18th centuries, being its capital city for many years.
During this period, it was one of the largest cities in the world.
The city was captured by the forces of the Afsharid ruler Nader Shah in 1739.
Although the Mughal authority was re-established, it fell into a period of 
decay while being contested among the Afghans and the Sikhs between 1748 
and 1798, eventually becoming capital of the Sikh Empire in the early 19th 
century. Lahore was annexed to the British Raj in 1849 and became the capital
of British Punjab.<b>Lahore</b> was central to the independence movements of 
British India, with the city being the site of both the Declaration of 
Indian Independence and the resolution calling for the establishment of
<a href="index.html">Pakistan</a> It experienced some of the worst rioting
during the partition of British India preceding <a href="index.html">
Pakistan</a>'s establishment. Following the success of the
<a href="index.html">Pakistan</a> Movement and the subsequent partition
in <q>1947</q>, Lahore was declared the capital of Pakistan's Punjab province.</p>
